For class
this is for talking about how the sudoku solver code works.
you making the computer take guesses and then if the guess is wrong you get rid of the guess to solve the sudoku.
when the guess would be wrong you would use the return false as used for thre row collum and 3*3.
when using the return false that is a function.
another thing is the return true function.
that put the guesses as true
but they are not always true and there is another step
we would reset the sudoku abd try again and the code to reset would be "puzzle[row][col] = -1"
if the sudoku was still not solved then the sudoku is not valid and cant be solved ever
